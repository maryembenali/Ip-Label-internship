# Ip-Label-internship
Welcome to the README file of the R&D Department's 8-week internship project at [ip-label](https://www.ip-label.fr/)! Our goal was to improve their Real User Monitoring (RUM) solution through a research-oriented approach. We had the privilege to select a project idea that aligned with the company's objectives. This document provides an overview of our project's objectives, methodologies, and achievements. Throughout this 8-week internship, we aimed to enhance the RUM solution and create a lasting impact on performance monitoring. Let's explore the progress we've made and the valuable contributions in ip-label's RUM solution.
## The future of Application Performance Monitoring (APM) solutions in the next 50 years
For the research on the future of Application Performance Monitoring (APM) solutions in the next 50 years, we embarked on a comprehensive exploration. To begin the exercise, we delved into the meaning of APM and RUM (Real User Monitoring), understanding their significance in the realm of performance monitoring. Additionally, we traced the evolutionary path of APM solutions, identifying key advancements and trends that have shaped their development over time.

My approach to envisioning the future of RUM involved a forward-thinking perspective. I recognized that to forecast the future of RUM, we must first anticipate the future of applications and the metrics that will drive data collection. By doing so, we can effectively evaluate and enhance application performance in a holistic manner.

As part of the research process, I conducted a small survey using a Google Form, which allowed me to gather insights and ideas from my peers and potential future users of APM solutions.
### The Future of Applications
- Neuro-Interface Applications:
Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) will pave the way for applications controlled by the power of thought, providing unprecedented levels of accessibility and functionality.
- Emotionally Intelligent Applications:
Applications will be equipped with Emotional AI, enabling them to perceive and respond to users' emotions, leading to more personalized and empathetic experiences.
- AR/VR/MR Technologies:
Augmented Reality (AR), Virtual Reality (VR), and Mixed Reality (MR) applications will become mainstream, transforming how we interact with digital content and the physical world.
- Cloud-Based Apps:
Cloud-native applications will dominate, providing scalable, flexible, and cost-effective solutions for various industries and user needs.
