# Ip-Label-internship
Welcome to the README file of the R&D Department's 8-week internship project at [ip-label](https://www.ip-label.fr/)! Our goal was to improve their Real User Monitoring (RUM) solution through a research-oriented approach. We had the privilege to select a project idea that aligned with the company's objectives. This document provides an overview of our project's objectives, methodologies, and achievements. Throughout this 8-week internship, we aimed to enhance the RUM solution and create a lasting impact on performance monitoring. Let's explore the progress we've made and the valuable contributions in ip-label's RUM solution.
## The future of Application Performance Monitoring (APM) solutions in the next 50 years
For the research on the future of Application Performance Monitoring (APM) solutions in the next 50 years, we embarked on a comprehensive exploration. To begin the exercise, we delved into the meaning of APM and RUM (Real User Monitoring), understanding their significance in the realm of performance monitoring. Additionally, we traced the evolutionary path of APM solutions, identifying key advancements and trends that have shaped their development over time.

My approach to envisioning the future of RUM involved a forward-thinking perspective. I recognized that to forecast the future of RUM, we must first anticipate the future of applications and the metrics that will drive data collection. By doing so, we can effectively evaluate and enhance application performance in a holistic manner.

As part of the research process, I conducted a small survey using a Google Form, which allowed me to gather insights and ideas from my peers and potential future users of APM solutions.
### The Future of Applications
- Neuro-Interface Applications:
Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) will pave the way for applications controlled by the power of thought, providing unprecedented levels of accessibility and functionality.
- Emotionally Intelligent Applications:
Applications will be equipped with Emotional AI, enabling them to perceive and respond to users' emotions, leading to more personalized and empathetic experiences.
- AR/VR/MR Technologies:
Augmented Reality (AR), Virtual Reality (VR), and Mixed Reality (MR) applications will become mainstream, transforming how we interact with digital content and the physical world.
- Cloud-Based Apps:
Cloud-native applications will dominate, providing scalable, flexible, and cost-effective solutions for various industries and user needs.
- Applications Fully Developed by AI:
AI-powered application development will be more prevalent, where AI systems autonomously create and optimize applications.
Enhancements in APM Solutions </br> </br>
To keep up with these future advancements in applications, APM solutions will need to evolve and adapt. Here are the new features that can be added to APM solutions to meet the demands of the future:
### Possible enhancements in APM Solutions

- Emotion Monitoring and User Sentiment Analysis:
Integrate sentiment analysis and emotion recognition tools into APM solutions, allowing real-time assessment of user emotions and reactions during application interactions.

- AR/VR/MR Performance Metrics:
Enhance APM capabilities to capture and analyze specific performance metrics unique to AR, VR, and MR applications, ensuring seamless experiences in these immersive environments.

- Cloud Performance Optimization:
  Implement cloud-specific monitoring to analyze application performance across various cloud providers, enabling businesses to optimize performance and cost-efficiency.</br>
APM solutions will also facilitate application migration to the cloud, analyzing compatibility, monitoring performance during and after migration, and providing recommendations to optimize configurations in the cloud environment.</br>
APM solutions can be seamlessly integrated into cloud-based DevOps tools and processes, enabling developers to have real-time insights into application performance during development and deployment stages.
- Integration with AI Development Platforms:
Seamlessly integrate APM solutions with AI development platforms, allowing continuous performance monitoring and optimization for applications
- Neuro-Interface APM:
Develop specialized APM modules to capture, interpret, and analyze real-time brainwave data from Neuro-Interface applications, gaining insights into user mental states during interactions.
Utilize AI algorithms to correlate brainwave patterns with application performance, enabling personalized adjustments based on the user's cognitive responses.
## Subject selection
[this file](idea.pptx) explains the process of choosing my internship project subject.
The Final thought on the project topic : Throughout this internship, I have the privilege of working on an exciting project focused on building a recommendation system. Leveraging the power of user interactions and usage patterns with IP-Label's remarkable solution, e-kara, our aim is to create a seamless user experience and revolutionize how recommendations are made. </br>

So after we chose to work on leveraging **recommendation systems**, we came to the conclusion that we need to extract the different client patterns that we will later use in various **recommendation scenarios**. These patterns will serve as the foundation for predicting the **next steps** for the user, suggesting helpful **features or content** that may appeal to them, and even recommending a **user interface** that suits their unique profile. By extracting and analyzing these patterns from user interactions and behavior, we aim to enhance the overall user experience and provide **personalized recommendations** that cater to individual preferences and needs. Our project aims to harness the power of **recommendation systems** to create a more engaging and tailored experience for our users, ultimately leading to increased user satisfaction and retention.

In a next step, I conducted research on commonly used classification models in recommendation techniques and identified the most suitable ones for our case. [This file](benchmark1.pptx) serves as documentation of that research.
